# EatFast Mobile App - Interface Testing Report

## Executive Summary
I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the EatFast mobile application to identify implemented features, missing implementations, and display errors. The app is well-structured with a multi-role architecture supporting customers, restaurant owners, drivers, and administrators.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ **FIXED: Login Functionality Issue**
**Problem**: Login was not proceeding when credentials were entered.
**Root Cause**: The authentication provider was using overly strict validation (checking for non-empty email only).
**Solution**: Updated the login validation to accept valid email format with password length >= 6 characters.
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### ✅ **FIXED: Forgot Password Button Styling**
**Problem**: Small pixel display error on the "Se connecter" button.
**Root Cause**: Missing proper button styling and minimum touch target size.
**Solution**: Added proper TextButton styling with minimum size and padding.
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
