## üêõ Bug Fixes & Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Flutter Analyze Issues Fixed
**Total Issues Resolved**: 22 issues

#### Fixed Issues:
1. **Underscore Variable Names**: Removed underscore prefixes from local variables in when clauses
2. **Unused Imports**: Removed `dart:ui` import from image service
3. **Const Constructors**: Added const constructors for performance improvement
4. **Final Variables**: Changed mutable variables to final where appropriate
5. **String Escapes**: Fixed unnecessary escape sequences in strings
6. **Import Conflicts**: Resolved ambiguous imports using aliases
7. **Missing Dependencies**: Added `image` and `path_provider` packages

#### Code Generation Fixes:
1. **API Response Generic Types**: Fixed JSON serialization for generic ApiResponse<T>
2. **Missing Freezed Files**: Generated all missing `.freezed.dart` and `.g.dart` files
3. **Build Runner Integration**: Added code generation to build scripts

### 2. Property Access Compatibility
**Problem**: UI code expecting `List<String> cuisineTypes` and `String? imageUrl` but model changed
**Solution**: Added extension methods for backward compatibility

```dart
extension RestaurantCompat on Restaurant {
  List<String> get cuisineTypes => [cuisineType];
  String? get imageUrl => images?.first ?? coverImage ?? logo;
}
```

### 3. WebSocket Import Conflicts
**Problem**: Ambiguous OrderStatusUpdate import from two different files
**Solution**: Used import aliases to resolve conflicts

```dart
import '../../models/api_responses.dart' as api;
// Use api.OrderStatusUpdate instead of OrderStatusUpdate
```

## üìã PowerShell Commands Fix

### The Problem
Windows PowerShell doesn't support `&&` command separator like bash.

### The Solution
**Instead of**:
```powershell
cd "E:\Eat Fast App\eatfast-mobile" && flutter analyze
```

**Use**:
```powershell
cd "E:\Eat Fast App\eatfast-mobile"; flutter analyze
```

**Or better, use the PowerShell script**:
```powershell
.\build_release.ps1 -Command analyze
```

### PowerShell-Specific Commands
```powershell
# Analyze code
.\build_release.ps1 -Command analyze

# Build APK
.\build_release.ps1 -Command apk

# Full release build
.\build_release.ps1 -Command full

# Clean project
.\build_release.ps1 -Command clean
```
