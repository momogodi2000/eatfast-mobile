# Flutter Analyze Summary

Based on the analysis of the EatFast mobile app, here are the findings:

## Analysis Status
- **flutter analyze** command times out (45+ seconds), indicating potential performance issues or large number of files
- Project structure shows comprehensive features but likely has analyze errors

## Observed Issues from Code Review

### 1. Missing Dependencies
- References to non-existent files and imports
- `GuestOrderTrackingScreen` referenced but incomplete implementation
- Missing model classes: `GuestOrderData`, `GuestOrderRequest`, etc.

### 2. Incomplete Implementations
- Many TODOs in checkout screen (`// TODO: Navigate to address selection screen`)
- Payment method selection not fully implemented
- Location services placeholder code

### 3. Potential Analyze Errors
- Import errors for missing files
- Incomplete model definitions
- Unused imports likely present

## Recommendations
1. Run flutter analyze with specific error filtering
2. Fix import errors for missing files
3. Complete incomplete implementations
4. Remove unused imports and dead code

## Next Steps
- Focus on completing missing implementations before running comprehensive analyze
- Prioritize payment flow completion
- Ensure all referenced files exist
